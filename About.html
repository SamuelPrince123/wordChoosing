    <h1>Welcome to PicLingua</h1>

    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2rem; color: #ad1457; margin-bottom: 30px; text-align: center;">
      The challenge is clear: countless people around the world struggle to speak and truly understand English â€” not just in casual conversation, but even when listening to professionals on BBC, CNN, or other global platforms. This language barrier can hold back opportunities and confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>PicLingua</strong> is your complete language learning companion â€” covering all four essential skills:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reading</strong> â€” through the engaging start of the photo-reading game (From Grade 1) and also by exploring the live news section, helping you absorb vocabulary in real-world and visual contexts.</li>
      <li><strong>Writing</strong> â€” via tests where you create meaningful sentences and receive intelligent feedback.</li>
      <li><strong>Speaking</strong> â€” (Coming soon) an advanced AI model will interact with your voice to improve pronunciation and fluency.</li>
      <li><strong>Listening</strong> â€” (Coming soon) immersive audio features will help you develop sharp listening skills in natural contexts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>PicLingua</strong> is not just another English platform â€” it's a revolution in how words are learned and remembered. Here, youâ€™ll explore the power of <strong>photo-reading</strong>, a proven method that helps learners of all ages retain vocabulary faster, longer, and more meaningfully. At PicLingua, we believe that learning should not just be effective â€” it should be unforgettable.
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes <strong>PicLingua</strong> truly stand out is its structured learning system. Youâ€™ll access vocabulary from many different levels and academic grades â€” all designed to meet and even exceed the <strong>highest international standards of English</strong>. Whether youâ€™re a beginner or striving for fluency, PicLingua gives you vocabulary thatâ€™s rich, relevant, and ready to power your communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the heart of PicLingua is our powerful test system. After learning vocabulary, youâ€™ll take tests where, for each word, youâ€™ll be required to write <strong>two clear, logical, and meaningful sentences</strong>. This isnâ€™t just practice â€” itâ€™s your chance to apply what youâ€™ve learned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once your test is submitted, every sentence is automatically analyzed using <strong>LanguageTool</strong>, which checks for grammar, clarity, sentence structure, and vocabulary. Youâ€™ll receive a score based on your performance, and your results will be featured on the PicLingua <strong>scoreboard</strong>, motivating you to grow and improve.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <strong>PicLingua</strong>, testing is not about pressure â€” itâ€™s about proving progress. Every sentence you write is a reflection of your growth and mastery, and each score is a step forward in your journey toward language excellence.
    </p>

    <h2>The Future of PicLingua</h2>
    <p>
      The journey doesnâ€™t stop here. In the near future, <strong>PicLingua</strong> will introduce an advanced AI model that actively engages with you â€” adapting to your grade and level. This AI will ask questions, guide your responses, correct your speech, and boost your fluency â€” helping you become a confident speaker of English, naturally and effortlessly.
